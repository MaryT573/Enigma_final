# Enigma_final

Here is my final project for Module 1 of Turing: Enigma. Below I have gone through the sections of the rubric in order to self evaluate the grade for this project.

### Functionality: 2.8

I gave myself a 2.8 on functionality because my encrypt, decrypt, and CLI are all working correctly. I took some points off because I could not figure out how to test encrypt for taking in a message and a date, while leaving out the key. I did build out the method to account for that situation. I was able to get it to work with a key and no date, however.

### OOP: 4

I gave myself a 4 on OOP because I used both a module and two instances of inheritance. In addition, my classes are also directed towards accomplishing specific pieces of functionality and are appropriately encapsulated.

### Ruby Conventions and Mechanics: 2.5

I gave myself a 2.5, because I think I did an ok job of using best enumerables and data structures. The main reason I took off points was because I misread the instructions and named my classes containing the encrypt and decrypt method, by the same name. This meant that when I was building out my runner files for the CLI I was unable to use those names without substantial changes across multiple classes. Therefore my project does not follow the interaction patterns listed in the guidelines, exactly.

### TDD: 2.7

I gave myself a 2.7 on TDD because in general I think I did a fairly good job of creating test coverage as well as writing tests before methods. My overall project based coverage from simplecov is a 97.2%. The main expectation is my encrypt class which has one block that I couldn't figure out how to test. That class's coverage is 89.66%, while every other class is 100%.

### Version Control: 4

I gave myself a 4 on the version control section because I made over 40 commits and 10 pull requests. The commits were largely for smaller functionality, while my pull requests were either for entire classes or major reorganization and refactoring.

## Total Score: 3.2
